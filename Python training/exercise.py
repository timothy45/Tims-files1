# 1. This is the print statement
#print("Hello world")

# 2. This is a variable and command to print variable (this varaible is a string)
#message = "Level Two"
#print (message)

#3 You can ask Python what type a variable is.
#print(type(message))


# 4. Another type of variable is an integer (a whole number)
#a = 123
#b = 654
#c = a + b
#print (c)


# 5. You can use other operators like subtract (-) and multiply (*)




# 6. Variables keep their value until you change it
#a= 100
#print(a)
#c=50
#print(c)
#d = 10 + a - c
#print (d)



# 7. You can also use '+' to add together two strings
#greeting = 'Hi '
#name = 'Tim'  # enter your name in this string
#message = greeting + name
#print(message)


# 8. Try adding a number and a string together and you get an error:
age =  65
name = 'Tim'
#print(name + ' is ' + age + ' years old') this produces error. correct shown below

# 9. We can convert numbers to strings like this:
#print(name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old')

# 10. Another variable type is called a boolean
# This means either True or False
raspberry_pi_is_fun = True
raspberry_pi_is_expensive = False
#= is an assignment operator
#== is an equality operator
#bobs_age = 14
#your_age = 15
#print(your_age == bobs_age)  # this prints either True or False



# 11. We can use less than and greater than too - these are < and >
#bob_is_older = bobs_age > your_age
#print(bob_is_older)  # do you expect True or False?

# 12. We can ask questions before printing with an if statement
#money = 500
#phone_cost = 201
#tablet_cost = 300
#total_cost = phone_cost + tablet_cost
#can_afford_both = money >= total_cost
#if can_afford_both:
 #   message = "You have enough money for both"
#else:
  #  message = "You can't afford both devices"
#print(message)  # what do you expect to see here?


  

# 13. You can keep many items in a type of variable called a list
#colours = ['Red', 'Orange', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Indigo', 'Violet']
# You can check whether a colour is in the list
#print('Black' in colours)  # Prints True or False
# You can add to the list with append
#colours.append('Black')
#colours.append('White')
#print('Black' in colours)  # Prints True or False
#print (colours)


# 14. You can add two lists together in to a new list using +

primary_colours = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow']

secondary_colours = ['Purple', 'Orange', 'Green']

#main_colours = primary_colours + secondary_colours


#print (main_colours)



# 15. You can find how many there are by using len(your_list). Try it below

# How many colours are there in main_colours?

len(primary_colours)

# GO!
