'''String Formatting
Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings.
The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list),
together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".

Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)
'''

# This prints out "Hello, John!"
name = "John"
print("Hello, %s!" % name)
